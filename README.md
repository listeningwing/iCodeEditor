More than just a code editor, but also a file manager, universal document viewer and multimedia player. In fact, emphasise the app is also a highly efficient file manager is never too much. Since 2012, the app was originally developed as a code editor for iPad for code review, and later, iPhone also supported, while reading code and viewing files on an iPhone is certainly convenient and useful, but editing text file on iPad is even better. Today's iCodeEditor is almost brand new after years of continuous development, reliable, small and fast. Large software is considered harmful, this small code editor also follows the design philosophy, making software as small as possible, pursue terseness and performance.
